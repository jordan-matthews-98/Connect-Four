* The ai was designed with the ability to use a machine learning algorithm to optimize it via changing the BASE_WEIGHT, COMBO_WEIGHT, and DEFENSIVE_WEIGHT values.
* As the program is small and was made for personal use, robustness was not taken into account.
* The functions isWin() and repaint() were based on code from http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/67675/
